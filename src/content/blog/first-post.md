Web development is constantly evolving. Let's explore some key trends that are shaping the future of how we build for the web.

## Server-Side Technologies

Modern web development is seeing a renaissance in server-side rendering. Here's why it matters:

- **Performance Benefits**: Faster initial page loads
- **SEO Advantages**: Better search engine visibility
- **Enhanced Security**: Reduced client-side vulnerabilities

## Developer Experience

The focus on developer experience has never been stronger:

1. Improved tooling
2. Automated workflows
3. Integrated development environments

### Best Practices

Maintaining clean code and following best practices remains crucial:

```javascript
// Example of modern JavaScript
const handleError = async (fn) => {
  try {
    await fn();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  }
};
```

Remember to always prioritize accessibility and performance in your projects.
