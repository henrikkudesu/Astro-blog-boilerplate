# Understanding the Astro Blog Boilerplate

In this post, we explore the structure and key components of the Astro Blog Boilerplateâ€”a starting point designed to help you build a scalable, content-rich website.

## 1. Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **src/**  
   Contains all source files, including:
  - **content/**: Houses all your content files.
    - **blog/**: Contains Markdown files for blog posts.
    - **authors/**: Stores JSON files with author data.
  - **components/**: Reusable UI components.
  - **assets/**: Local assets (e.g., images) that can take advantage of Astro's optimization.
- **public/**  
   Serves static assets which are not processed by Astro's Image Service.

## 2. Content Collections and Configuration

The `content.config.ts` file is the heart of content management. It defines collections using Astro Content Collections and validates them with the Zod library. For example:

- **Blog Posts**:  
   Uses a glob loader to recursively load all Markdown files in `src/content/blog`. The `blogSchema` ensures that fields like `title`, `date`, `pubDate`, `author`, and `tags` are provided and conform to expected types.
- **Authors**:  
   Loads author data from a JSON file (`src/content/authors/authors.json`), where each author is validated to maintain consistent information.

See more about `content.config.ts` [here](./first-post).

## 3. Zod Schemas and Validation

The project relies on **Zod** for schema validation:

- **Type Safety**:  
   Zod enforces that each content entry (blog post, author, etc.) has the correct type (e.g., string, date, array).
- **Custom Validators**:  
   A custom `dateValidator` function is used to ensure that dates are not set in the future, triggering errors during build or development if a future date is provided.
- **Coercion**:  
   Fields such as `pubDate` and `updatedDate` use Zod's coercion methods to automatically convert string inputs into JavaScript Date objects.

## 4. Built-in Features

The boilerplate also offers:

- **Automatic Routing**:  
   Markdown posts are automatically converted into routes based on their file structure.
- **Hot Module Reloading**:  
   Changes during development are immediately reflected without needing to restart the server.
- **Optimized Build Process**:  
   Assets and content are optimized for production, making deployment easier.

## Conclusion

The Astro Blog Boilerplate provides a robust starting point for managing content through well-defined collections, strict validation using Zod, and an organized file structure. This setup allows you to focus on creating content and building features without worrying about complex configurations.

Happy coding!
